# Data Visualization Tool

A modern web application for creating and customizing data visualizations. Built with React and powered by Recharts, this tool allows users to upload and visualize their data in various chart formats.

## File Structure Requirements

This tool accepts CSV files with specific formatting requirements:

### Valid Format
The CSV file should have:
- A header row with column names
- Numeric values without currency symbols or special formatting
- No quotes around numeric values
- Consistent data types within columns

Example of valid data:
```csv
name,value,category
January,400,Category A
February,300,Category B
March,600,Category A
```

### Invalid Format
The following formats are not supported:
- Numbers with currency symbols or special formatting (e.g., "400,00", "600.00")
- Non-numeric values in numeric columns
- Inconsistent data types within columns
- Missing or malformed headers

Example of invalid data:
```csv
name,value,category
January,"400,00",Category A
February,300,Category B
March,"600.00",Category A
```
